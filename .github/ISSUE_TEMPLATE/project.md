## What's the idea?

A book club to read _7 Languages in 7 Weeks_.

[Publisher site](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks)
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X)

**Official blurb**

> You should learn a programming language every year, as recommended by The Pragmatic Programmer. But if one per year is good, how about Seven Languages in Seven Weeks? In this book you’ll get a hands-on tour of Clojure, Haskell, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, and Ruby. Whether or not your favorite language is on that list, you’ll broaden your perspective of programming by examining these languages side-by-side. You’ll learn something new from each, and best of all, you’ll learn how to learn a language quickly.
>
> Just as each new spoken language can make you smarter and increase your options, each programming language increases your mental tool kit, adding new abstractions you can throw at each new problem. Knowledge is power. The Seven in Seven series builds on that power across many different dimensions. Each chapter in each book walks you through some nontrivial problem with each language, or database, or web server. These books take commitment to read, but their impact can be profound.

## Why should people participate?

This book covers seven languages that each have a different [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm). The book's curriculum covers each language in a week, with 3 days of exercises for each. This exposes you only to the beginnings of how to use each language, but highlights the key differences in how the think about problem solving.

If you want to expand the way you think about programming and/or find a new language to dive in to this is a great way to do that.

Even if you never use the languages the book exposes you to, you can take these new approaches to problem solving to your day-to-day language of choice.
